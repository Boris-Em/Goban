SGF Properties (FF[4])

Move properties

Property:	B
Propvalue:	move
Propertytype:	move
Function:	Execute a black move. This is one of the most used properties
in actual collections. As long as
the given move is syntactically correct it should be executed.
It doesn't matter if the move itself is illegal
(e.g. recapturing a ko in a Go game).
Have a look at how to execute a Go-move.
B and W properties must not be mixed within a node.
Related:	W, KO

Property:	KO
Propvalue:	none
Propertytype:	move
Function:	Execute a given move (B or W) even it's illegal. This is
an optional property, SGF viewers themselves should execute
ALL moves. It's purpose is to make it easier for other
applications (e.g. computer-players) to deal with illegal
moves. A KO property without a black or white move within
the same node is illegal.
Related:	W, B

Property:	MN
Propvalue:	number
Propertytype:	move
Function:	Sets the move number to the given value, i.e. a move
specified in this node has exactly this move-number. This
can be useful for variations or printing.
Related:	B, W, FG, PM

Property:	W
Propvalue:	move
Propertytype:	move
Function:	Execute a white move. This is one of the most used properties
in actual collections. As long as
the given move is syntactically correct it should be executed.
It doesn't matter if the move itself is illegal
(e.g. recapturing a ko in a Go game).
Have a look at how to execute a Go-move.
B and W properties must not be mixed within a node.
Related:	B, KO
Setup properties

Restrictions

AB, AW and AE must have unique points, i.e. it is illegal to place different colors on the same point within one node.
AB, AW and AE values which don't change the board, e.g. placing a black stone with AB[] over a black stone that's already there, is bad style. Applications may want to delete these values and issue a warning.
Property:	AB
Propvalue:	list of stone
Propertytype:	setup
Function:	Add black stones to the board. This can be used to set up
positions or problems. Adding is done by 'overwriting' the
given point with black stones. It doesn't matter what
was there before. Adding a stone doesn't make any prisoners
nor any other captures (e.g. suicide). Thus it's possible
to create illegal board positions.
Points used in stone type must be unique.
Related:	AW, AE, PL

Property:	AE
Propvalue:	list of point
Propertytype:	setup
Function:	Clear the given points on the board. This can be used
to set up positions or problems. Clearing is done by
'overwriting' the given points, so that they contain no
stones. It doesn't matter what was there before.
Clearing doesn't count as taking prisoners.
Points must be unique.
Related:	AB, AW, PL

Property:	AW
Propvalue:	list of stone
Propertytype:	setup
Function:	Add white stones to the board. This can be used to set up
positions or problems. Adding is done by 'overwriting' the
given points with white stones. It doesn't matter what
was there before. Adding a stone doesn't make any prisoners
nor any other captures (e.g. suicide). Thus it's possible
to create illegal board positions.
Points used in stone type must be unique.
Related:	AB, AE, PL

Property:	PL
Propvalue:	color
Propertytype:	setup
Function:	PL tells whose turn it is to play. This can be used when
setting up positions or problems.
Related:	AE, AB, AW
Node annotation properties

Property:	C
Propvalue:	text
Propertytype:	-
Function:	Provides a comment text for the given node. The purpose of
providing both a node name and a comment is to have a short
identifier like "doesn't work" or "Dia. 15" that can be
displayed directly with the properties of the node, even if
the comment is turned off or shown in a separate window.
See text-type for more info.
Related:	N, ST, V, UC, DM, HO

Property:	DM
Propvalue:	double
Propertytype:	-
Function:	The position is even. SGF viewers should display a
message. This property may indicate main variations in
opening libraries (joseki) too. Thus DM[2] indicates an
even result for both players and that this is a main
variation of this joseki/opening.
This property must not be mixed with UC, GB or GW
within a node.
Related:	UC, GW, GB

Property:	GB
Propvalue:	double
Propertytype:	-
Function:	Something good for black. SGF viewers should display a
message. The property is not related to any specific place
on the board, but marks the whole node instead.
GB must not be mixed with GW, DM or UC within a node.
Related:	GW, C, UC, DM

Property:	GW
Propvalue:	double
Propertytype:	-
Function:	Something good for white. SGF viewers should display a
message. The property is not related to any specific place
on the board, but marks the whole node instead.
GW must not be mixed with GB, DM or UC within a node.
Related:	GB, C, UC, DM

Property:	HO
Propvalue:	double
Propertytype:	-
Function:	Node is a 'hotspot', i.e. something interesting (e.g.
node contains a game-deciding move).
SGF viewers should display a message.
The property is not related to any specific place
on the board, but marks the whole node instead.
Sophisticated applications could implement the navigation
command next/previous hotspot.
Related:	GB, GW, C, UC, DM

Property:	N
Propvalue:	simpletext
Propertytype:	-
Function:	Provides a name for the node. For more info have a look at
the C-property.
Related:	C, ST, V

Property:	UC
Propvalue:	double
Propertytype:	-
Function:	The position is unclear. SGF viewers should display a
message. This property must not be mixed with DM, GB or GW
within a node.
Related:	DM, GW, GB

Property:	V
Propvalue:	real
Propertytype:	-
Function:	Define a value for the node.  Positive values are good for
black, negative values are good for white.
The interpretation of particular values is game-specific.
In Go, this is the estimated score.
Related:	C, N, RE
Move annotation properties

Restrictions

Move annotation properties without a move (B[] or W[]) within the same node are senseless and therefore illegal. Applications should delete such properties and issue a warning.
BM, TE, DO and IT are mutual exclusive, i.e. they must not be mixed within a single node.
Property:	BM
Propvalue:	double
Propertytype:	move
Function:	The played move is bad.
Viewers should display a message.
Related:	TE, DO, IT

Property:	DO
Propvalue:	none
Propertytype:	move
Function:	The played move is doubtful.
Viewers should display a message.
Related:	BM, TE, IT

Property:	IT
Propvalue:	none
Propertytype:	move
Function:	The played move is interesting.
Viewers should display a message.
Related:	BM, DO, TE

Property:	TE
Propvalue:	double
Propertytype:	move
Function:	The played move is a tesuji (good move).
Viewers should display a message.
Related:	BM, DO, IT
Markup properties

Restrictions

CR, MA, SL, SQ and TR points must be unique, i.e. it's illegal to have two or more of these markups on the same point within a node.
Property:	AR
Propvalue:	list of composed point ':' point
Propertytype:	-
Function:	Viewers should draw an arrow pointing FROM the first point
TO the second point.
It's illegal to specify the same arrow twice,
e.g. (Go) AR[aa:bb][aa:bb]. Different arrows may have the same
starting or ending point though.
It's illegal to specify a one point arrow, e.g. AR[cc:cc]
as it's impossible to tell into which direction the
arrow points.
Related:	TR, CR, LB, SL, MA, SQ, LN

Property:	CR
Propvalue:	list of point
Propertytype:	-
Function:	Marks the given points with a circle.
Points must be unique.
Related:	TR, MA, LB, SL, AR, SQ, LN

Property:	DD
Propvalue:	elist of point
Propertytype:	inherit
Function:	Dim (grey out) the given points.
Have a look at the picture to get an idea.
DD[] clears any setting, i.e. it undims everything.
Related:	VW

Property:	LB
Propvalue:	list of composed point ':' simpletext
Propertytype:	-
Function:	Writes the given text on the board. The text should be
centered around the given point. Note: there's no longer
a restriction to the length of the text to be displayed.
Have a look at the FF4 example file on possibilities
to display long labels (pictures five and six).
Points must be unique.
Related:	TR, CR, MA, SL, AR, SQ, LN

Property:	LN
Propvalue:	list of composed point ':' point
Propertytype:	-
Function:	Applications should draw a simple line form one point
to the other.
It's illegal to specify the same line twice,
e.g. (Go) LN[aa:bb][aa:bb]. Different lines may have the same
starting or ending point though.
It's illegal to specify a one point line, e.g. LN[cc:cc].
Related:	TR, CR, MA, SL, AR, SQ, LB


Property:	MA
Propvalue:	list of point

Function:	Provides the name and version number of the application used
to create this gametree.
The name should be unique and must not be changed for
different versions of the same program.
The version number itself may be of any kind, but the format
used must ensure that by using an ordinary string-compare,
one is able to tell if the version is lower or higher
than another version number.
Here's the list of known applications and their names:

Application		     System	  Name

Default value is 'ISO-8859-1' aka 'Latin1'.
Only charset names (or their aliases) as specified in RFC 1345
(or updates thereof) are allowed.
Basically this field uses the same names as MIME messages in
their 'charset=' field (in Content-Type).
RFC's can be obtained via FTP from DS.INTERNIC.NET,
NIS.NSF.NET, WUARCHIVE.WUSTL.EDU, SRC.DOC.IC.AC.UK
or FTP.IMAG.FR.
Related:	FF, C, text type

Property:	FF
Propvalue:	number (range: 1-4)
Propertytype:	root
Function:	Defines the used file format. For difference between those
formats have a look at the history of SGF.
Default value: 1
Applications must be able to deal with different file formats
within a collection.
Related:	GM, SZ, ST, AP, CA

Property:	GM
Propvalue:	number (range: 1-16)
Propertytype:	root
Function:	Defines the type of game, which is stored in the current
gametree. The property should help applications
to reject games, they cannot handle.
Valid numbers are: Go = 1, Othello = 2, chess = 3,
Gomoku+Renju = 4, Nine Men's Morris = 5, Backgammon = 6,
Chinese chess = 7, Shogi = 8, Lines of Action = 9,
Ataxx = 10, Hex = 11, Jungle = 12, Neutron = 13,
Philosopher's Football = 14, Quadrature = 15, Trax = 16,
Tantrix = 17, Amazons = 18, Octi = 19, Gess = 20,

Tumbling Down = 33, Sahara = 34, Byte = 35, Focus = 36,
Dvonn = 37, Tamsk = 38, Gipf = 39, Kropki = 40.
Default value: 1
Different kind of games may appear within a collection.
Related:	FF, SZ, ST, AP, CA

Property:	ST
Propvalue:	number (range: 0-3)
Propertytype:	root
Function:	Defines how variations should be shown (this is needed to
synchronize the comments with the variations). If ST is omitted
viewers should offer the possibility to change the mode online.
Basically most programs show variations in two ways:
as markup on the board (if the variation contains a move)
and/or as a list (in a separate window).
The style number consists two options.
1) show variations of successor node (children) (value: 0)
show variations of current node   (siblings) (value: 1)
affects markup & list
2) do board markup         (value: 0)
no (auto-) board markup (value: 2)
affects markup only.
Using no board markup could be used in problem collections
or if variations are marked by subsequent properties.
Viewers should take care, that the automatic variation
board markup DOESN'T overwrite any markup of other
properties.
The  final number is calculated by adding the values of each
option.	Example: 3 = no board markup/variations of current node
1 = board markup/variations of current node
Default value: 0
Related:	C, FF, GM, SZ, AP, CA

Property:	SZ
Propvalue:	(number | composed number ':' number)
Propertytype:	root
Function:	Defines the size of the board. If only a single value
is given, the board is a square; with two numbers given,
rectangular boards are possible.
If a rectangular board is specified, the first number specifies
the number of columns, the second provides the number of rows.
Square boards must not be defined using the compose type
value: e.g. SZ[19:19] is illegal.
The valid range for SZ is any size greater or equal to 1x1.
For Go games the maximum size is limited to 52x52.
Default value: game specific
for Go: 19 (square board)
for Chess: 8 (square board)
Different board sizes may appear within a collection.
See move-/point-type for more info.

Do not use other separators such as "/", " ", "," or ".".
Partial dates are allowed:
"YYYY" - game was played in YYYY
"YYYY-MM" - game was played in YYYY, month MM
For games that last more than one day: separate other dates
by a comma (no spaces!); following shortcuts may be used:
"MM-DD" - if preceded by YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM, MM-DD, MM or DD
"MM" - if preceded by YYYY-MM or MM
"DD" - if preceded by YYYY-MM-DD, MM-DD or DD
Shortcuts acquire the last preceding YYYY and MM (if
necessary).
Note: interpretation is done from left to right.
Examples:
1996-05,06 = played in May,June 1996
1996-05-06,07,08 = played on 6th,7th,8th May 1996

Miscellaneous properties

Property:	FG
Propvalue:	none | composition of number ":" SimpleText
Propertytype:	-
Function:	The figure property is used to divide a game into
different figures for printing: a new figure starts at the
node containing a figure property.
If the value is not empty then
- Simpletext provides a name for the diagram
- Number specifies some flags (for printing).
These flags are:
- coordinates on/off (value: 0/1)
- diagram name on/off (value: 0/2)
- list moves not shown in figure on/off (value: 0/4)
Some moves can't be shown in a diagram (e.g. ko
captures in Go) - these moves may be listed as text.
- remove captured stones on/off (value: 0/256)
'remove off' means: keep captured stones in the
diagram and don't overwrite stones played earlier -
this is the way diagrams are printed in books.
'remove on' means: capture and remove the stones from
the display - this is the usual viewer mode.
This flag is specific to Go (GM[1]).
- hoshi dots on/off (value: 0/512)
This flag is specific to Go (GM[1]).
- Ignore flags on/off (value: 32768)
If on, then all other flags should be ignored and
the application should use its own defaults.
The final number is calculated by summing up all flag values.
E.g. 515 = coordinates and diagram name off, remove captured
stones, list unshown moves, hoshi dots off;
257 = coordinates off, diagram name on, list unshown moves,
don't remove captured stones, hoshi dots on.
(this is how diagrams are printed in e.g. Go World)
Note: FG combined with VW, MN and PM are mighty tools to print
and compile diagrams.
Related:	MN, PM, VW

Property:	PM
Propvalue:	number
Propertytype:	inherit
Function:	This property is used for printing.
It specifies how move numbers should be printed.
0 ... don't print move numbers
1 ... print move numbers as they are
2 ... print 'modulo 100' move numbers
This mode is usually used in books or magazines.
Note: Only the first move number is calculated
'modulo 100' and the obtained number is increased
for each move in the diagram.
E.g. A figure containing moves
32-78  is printed as moves 32-78
102-177 is printed as moves  2-77
67-117 is printed as moves 67-117
154-213 is printed as moves 54-113
Default value: 1
Related:	MN, FG

Property:	VW
Propvalue:	elist of point
Propertytype:	inherit
Function:	View only part of the board. The points listed are
visible, all other points are invisible.
Note: usually the point list is given in compressed
format (see 'point' type)!
Points have to be unique.
Have a look at the picture to get an idea.
VW[] clears any setting, i.e. the whole board is
visible again.
